_A doubly linked list implementation in CoffeeScript._

## Usage ##

**DoublyLinkedList** is an implementation of a doubly linked list in CoffeeScript.
    
Instantiate it empty or with an array.

    {DoublyLinkedList} = require('./')
    list = new DoublyLinkedList([1, 2, 3])
    console.log(list.toString())
    # 1,2,3
    
Push stuff onto the end or unshift stuff onto the beginning.

    list.push(4)
    list.unshift(0)
    console.log(list.toString())
    # 0,1,2,3,4
    
Pop and shift.

    last = list.pop()
    first = list.shift()
    console.log(list.toString())
    # 1,2,3
    console.log(first, last)
    # 0 4
    
Maybe someday I'll implement a true iterator. In the mean time, you can walk before and after.

    current = list.head
    while current?
      console.log(current.value)
      current = current.after
    # 1
    # 2
    # 3
    
Insert before or after.

    list.head.after.insertBefore(1.5)
    list.tail.before.insertAfter(2.5)    
    console.log(list.toString())
    # 1,1.5,2,2.5,3
